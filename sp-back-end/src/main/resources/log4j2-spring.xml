        Loggers
        *********

        Loggers are responsible for capturing events (called LogRecords)
        and passing them to the appropriate Appender.

        Loggers are objects that trigger log events.
        Loggers are created and called in the code of your Java application, where they generate events
        before passing them to an Appender. A class can have multiple independent Loggers
        responding to different events, and you can nest Loggers under other Loggers to create a hierarchy.

        Loggers provide several methods for triggering log events. However, before you can log an event, you need
        to assign a level. Log levels determine the severity of the log and can be used to filter the event or send
        it to a different Appender(for more information on log levels, see the Log Levels section).
        The Logger.log() method requires a level in addition to a message.

        logger.log(Level.WARNING, “This is a warning!”);

        Most logging frameworks provide shorthand methods for logging at a particular level. For example, the following statement produces the same output as the previous statement.

        logger.warning(“This is a warning!”);

        Appenders
        *********

        Appenders (also called Handlers in some logging frameworks) are responsible for recording
        log events to a destination. Appenders use Layouts to format events before sending them to an output.

        Appenders forward logs from Loggers to an output destination.
        During this process, log messages are formatted using a Layout before being
        delivered to their final destination. Multiple Appenders can be combined to write log events to multiple
        destinations. For instance, a single event can be simultaneously displayed in a console and written to a file.

        Note that java.util.logging refers to Appenders as Handlers.

        Layouts
        *******
        Layouts (also called Formatters in some logging frameworks)
        are responsible for converting and formatting the data in a log event.
        Layouts determine how the data looks when it appears in a log entry.

        Layouts convert the contents of a log entry from one data type into another. Logging frameworks
        provide Layouts for plain text, HTML, syslog, XML, JSON, serialized, and other logs.
        Note that java.util.logging refers to Layouts as Formatters.
        For example, java.util.logging provides two Layouts: the SimpleFormatter and the XMLFormatter.
        SimpleFormatter, the default Layout for ConsoleHandlers, outputs plain text log entries

        When your application makes a logging call, the Logger records the event in a LogRecord and forwards it
        to the appropriate Appender. The Appender then formats the record using a Layout before
        sending it a destination such as the console, a file, or another application.
        Additionally, you can use one or more Filters to specify which Appenders should be used for which events.
        Filters aren’t required, but they give you greater control over the flow of your log messages.
